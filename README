KB harvester

This package provides a wrapper for downloading metadata and files for historical newspapers from the Koninklijke
Bibliotheek (the Dutch Royal Library/National Library of the Netherlands). The KB provides a Python module to access
their data services APIs, based on SRU and OAI-PMH.

The KB harvester allows you to get publicly available files for newspapers identified by their PPN and save them
locally.
